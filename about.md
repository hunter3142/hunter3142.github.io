I have always had a ridiculous obsession with taking things apart and figuring out what makes them work. The first thing I do when something stops working correctly, or sometimes even if it's still working just fine, is take it apart and make sense of how all of the parts work together to create the whole. The exercise of taking something apart, figuring out what isn't working correctly, fixing the problem, then putting it all back together to make it work again is always a rush for me. 

I have dabbled in programming throughout my life but never went past dipping my toes in, skilled programming always seemed so far out of reach. As I was preparing for the application process for a Masters in Statistics program I realized that programming was a large part of most cirriculums so I decided it was finally time to dive into the deep end and see how hard it really was. To my surprise it was much more accessible than I ever thought it would be.  

I quickly realized that my desire to learn more about programming wasn't abaiting and I definitely wasn't at a loss for new programming topics to explore. The ability to build things, both creatively and technically, satiated my passion for tinkering and my drive for knowledge. So I took the plunge and began my web development apprenticeship through Bloc. When I started the Bloc program my mentor ensured that my learning became exponential as he continuously challenged me and provided powerful industry insights. In short, programming plays on all of my strengths and I'm so excited to see where this life path will take me.
