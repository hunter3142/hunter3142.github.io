For what seemed like the longest time I kind of floated through life, not sure what I wanted to do or even how to start figuring out what I wanted to do. I've always been a learner and enjoy the practice of researching and exploring whatever interests me at the time but I never stayed on a particular subject for long. 

The other thing that has always been present in my life has been a ridiculous obsession with taking things apart and figuring out what makes them work. The first thing I do when something stops working correctly, or sometimes even if it's still working just fine, is take it apart and make sense of how all of the parts work together to create the whole. The ability to take apart something that is broken, figuring out what isn't working right, fixing the problem, then putting it all back together to make it work again is always a rush for me. 

I have tinkered on and off with programming but never really dove in head first because it always seemed so far out of reach. As I was preparing for the application process for a Masters in Statistics program I realized very quickly that programming was a large part of most cirriculums so I decided it was finally time to dive into programming and see what came of it. 

I quickly realized that my desire to learn more and more about programming wasn't abaiting nor was there any end in sight when it comes to programming knowledge. Also, the ability build things, both creatively and technically, satiated by passion for tinkering. In short, programming plays on all of my strengths and I'm so excited to see where this life path will take me.
